              <h1>How it started?</h1>
              <p>
                As we all know, 2020 was a year the world was striving to
                survive the global pandemic of covid-19. During these dire times
                we felt an urge to make an impact with whatever we had, and so
                we tried!! We tried to uplift the underprivileged and help the
                needy with all our resources and material we could arrange, it
                was tough but we didn't lose our hope and kept going in order to
                bring a change everyone was expecting the bigger authorities to
                bring in the societies on smaller levels. We started off as a
                group of bunch of highschoolers but now are a team of numerous
                people from different parts of the city and state! 28th March
                2021, the day we officially landed on the ground to serve our
                duties as the youth of the most rapidly progressing nation
                afterall, the main hope of a nation lies in the arms of its
                youth.

          <h1>About Our Team</h1>
          <p>
            Nayepankh foundation was initiated to bring a change and help people
            during the tough times of Covid. Later in the year, the NGO started
            to expand their operations and provide help to a wider section of
            the society. With this revamped vision, the NGO acquired the name of
            NayePankh – giving wings to uplift the underprivileged section of
            our society. NayePankh is one of the eminent NGOs espoused in
            providing food, sanitary napkins, clothes, educating underprivileged
            sectors of our society for the better future. We make efforts to
            solve daily problems faced by people of India. Most of the young
            women feel humiliating in public places during their menstrual
            cycle; to bring change we create awareness campaigns among woman and
            youths about personal hygiene, providing sanitary napkins. Also, in
            our endeavour to fight hunger we distribute food not only to the
            underprivileged community but also to the stray animals. We are also
            providing clothes to the poor families. Till date we have helped
            more than two lakhs of people. Although this seems quite a big
            achievement, but our goal is still not complete, therefore we’re
            continuing more with hustle. When lockdown was hitting hard, we took
            a decision and now we are a 12A and 80G certified NGO (that means if
            someone donates to NayePankh they will get a relief of 50%in income
            tax). The most striking feature about us is that we are completely
            led by the youths of our country, many of whom are still in their
            colleges and schools. We are on a mission to make this earth a
            better place to live for all creatures. We are here as 'BADALTE
            BHARAT KI NAYI TASVEER'!!

              Dear Supporters and Friends,<br /><br />
              NayePankh Foundation was founded with a simple yet powerful vision
              - to uplift the underprivileged and marginalized communities and
              provide them with access to education, healthcare, and basic
              necessities that we often take for granted. We strongly believe
              that every child has the right to dream and achieve their
              aspirations, irrespective of their socio-economic background. We
              have been working relentlessly towards this goal, but we need your
              support to continue our efforts and make a lasting impact. As you
              read this, countless children and families are struggling to
              survive without the most basic necessities. They lack access to
              clean water, sanitation, and proper healthcare facilities. Most of
              them are unable to attend school due to financial constraints or
              lack of infrastructure. They are trapped in a cycle of poverty and
              hopelessness, and they need our help. We at Nayepankh Foundation
              strive to break this cycle and provide a ray of hope to those in
              need. With your support, we can continue to provide education,
              healthcare, and other basic amenities to these communities. We can
              empower them to lead better lives and realize their true
              potential. Every donation, no matter how small, can make a huge
              difference. Your support can provide a child with a school
              uniform, a pair of shoes, or even a nutritious meal. It can
              provide a family with access to clean water, sanitation, and
              healthcare facilities. It can change the trajectory of someone's
              life forever. We understand that times are tough, and everyone is
              going through their own struggles. But we urge you to think of
              those who are less fortunate and extend a helping hand. Your
              generosity can make a world of difference to someone in need. We
              know that we can count on your support to continue our mission.
              Your donations will help us reach more communities and make a
              meaningful impact in the lives of those who need it the most.
              Let's come together and make a difference. Thank you for
              considering our cause and supporting Nayepankh Foundation. Your
              support means the world to us and those we serve. Let's work
              together to create a better world for all.<br /><br />
              With heartfelt gratitude, Prashant Shukla,<br /><br />
